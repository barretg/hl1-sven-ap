"""Hand-authored campaign facts that cannot be derived from the BSPs.

Everything that *can* be read out of the maps (which weapons exist where, which
monsters are present, how the maps chain together) is derived in
`build_campaign_data.py`. This module holds only the editorial decisions:
which campaigns exist, chapter grouping and names, which weapon pickups map to
which Archipelago item, and the logic gates.

This is the file to edit when tuning logic. Nothing else hard-codes these facts.

# --- Campaigns ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Sven Co-op ships four single-player conversions and one hub map that fronts
# all of them, `-sp_campaign_portal`. Each campaign is an independent run with
# its own missions, its own starting mission and its own finale, and a YAML
# toggle decides which of them are in a seed.
#
# Two facts about the hub drive the shape of this file.
#
# Its consoles are numbered, not named: the sign on each is a texture
# (`hl_ch01`, `of_ch07`, `ba_ch03`, and so on), so console N is simply "this
# campaign's Nth mission" and the mission *names* below are ours to choose. The
# numbering is not uniform, though. Half-Life's consoles are unpadded and start
# at 1 because its mission 0 has no console at all, Opposing Force's are padded
# and skip 06, and the rest run 01 upward. That is why `consoles` is an explicit
# list parallel to `chapters` rather than anything computed: the plugin gets a
# generated lookup table and never does arithmetic on a targetname.
#
# Chapter keys are permanent. `data/ids.json` keys every location by chapter,
# so renaming a key renumbers a location and breaks existing seeds. Names are
# free to change; keys are not. The Half-Life keys below are unchanged from when
# it was the only campaign, which is what keeps its ids stable.

# first and came out shifted a place against the maps, so `!ap` promised one
# chapter and dropped you in the one before it.

# the hub gives Opposing Force ten consoles and the game has twelve titles after
# boot camp; those are named for where the group starts and where it ends.

# so renaming one renumbers a location and breaks a seed already being played.
# That leaves a few reading oddly against their names -- `of_crush_depth` is "We
# Are Not Alone" -- which is worth a tidy-up before release and not during a run.

# `of4a5` is left out deliberately: nothing in any shipped map changelevels to it,
# so a check there could never fire and an item placed on it would be lost.

# scenery you run past, not objectives.
#
# So a location is one of three things:
#   - "you got to this part of the campaign": one per map, plus one per mission
#     for finishing it.
#   - "you found a charger": one per health or HEV unit placed in a map.
#   - "you found a weapon for the first time": one per weapon, for the whole
#     campaign rather than per map. The same shotgun in three levels is one
#     discovery, which is what made the old per-map `pickup` type feel arbitrary.
