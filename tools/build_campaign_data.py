"""Generate `apworld/half_life_sven/data/` from the shipped BSPs.

The Half-Life campaign maps are the source of truth for what a location can be:
we only ever create a check for something that provably exists in the map file.
The generated JSON is committed, so neither the apworld nor the client needs Sven
Co-op installed -- only this tool does.

Output is one file per campaign under `data/campaigns/`, plus `data/index.json`
for what is genuinely shared: the data version, the weapon pool, the logic groups
and the starting weapons. `data/__init__.py` merges them back into the single
dict the rest of the project reads.

Usage:
    python tools/build_campaign_data.py --maps "<...>/svencoop/maps"

    a player to that class's pad, so with a portal switched off its face is a way
    into the octagon and no way out again. The plugin watches for that.

    Two kinds of box come out of this. `booths` is the octagon itself, every face
    included, which is the region a player has to be put back out of. `face_<key>`
    is one portal, which is how the plugin tells whose booth somebody walked into

    Measured here rather than in the game because the game's answer cannot be
    trusted: `absmin`/`absmax` belong to the engine's link state and the portal is
    deliberately not linked. It also cannot be reasoned about from a single face,
