* DeathLink.

* DeathLink out and, if `lobby_death_link` says so, gibs the rest of the lobby
* with them; a DeathLink arriving from the multiworld gibs the lobby regardless,
* because being killed by one is the whole of what receiving one means, and this
* slot is eight people.
*
* `lobby_death_link` is "on" everywhere, "off" nowhere, or "non_arcade" -- every
* campaign but Suspension, where a run is long and a death is already counted
* against the medal. It is forced off wherever DeathLink itself is off: the
* death is still reported to the client, which is how the client decides
* anything at all, but a wipe with no DeathLink behind it means nothing.
*
* The only thing standing between the wipe and an infinite cascade is
* g_flDeathLinkImmuneUntil, which is always set *before* the wipe runs.
*
* Amnesty (see ForgiveDeath) can hold a local death back from the multiworld. It
* never holds back a wipe that is going to happen anyway.
