* the outside, so no map file is modified:
*
*   - MapChange is the choke point. Every route into a mission -- a portal
*     console, a console `changelevel`, the campaign's own end-of-map trigger --
*     goes through it, so one check covers them all.
*   - Mission travel is driven by the multiworld: `!ap` lists what is unlocked
*     and `!warp` enters it. The portal consoles run the same code path.

* Rewiring the portal consoles.

* console knows nothing about it. Rather than override the map script, we watch
* for the button press ourselves and run the same warp `!warp` would, so there is
* one route into a mission and one place that decides whether it is allowed.
*
* Every console is a pair of buttons named `<console>but1` / `<console>but2`, so
* trimming the suffix off a targetname gives the console. Which mission that
* console opens comes from a generated table (the `P` records in checkdata.txt)
* rather than from arithmetic on the number in the name, because the hub numbers
* its consoles differently in every campaign it fronts: Half-Life's are unpadded
* and start at `hl_ch1`, Opposing Force's are zero padded and skip `of_ch06`
* altogether, Blue Shift uses `bs_ch01`-`bs_ch06` and They Hunger `th_ep01`-`03`.
* Deriving the mission from the digits was right for Half-Life alone and wrong
* for Opposing Force in a way that would silently warp a player to the mission
* after the one they pressed.
*
* Note the portal map has no console for Half-Life's mission 0 (Black Mesa
* Inbound); reach it with `!warp 0`.
