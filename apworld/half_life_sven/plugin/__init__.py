"""The Sven Co-op server plugin, and installing it.

The AngelScript sources live inside the world package so that a zipped
`.apworld` carries everything needed to set the game up. That means they cannot
be read with plain filesystem calls, so every read goes through
`pkgutil.get_data`, which works identically for a folder world and a zipped one.

The tree under `plugins/` mirrors `<Sven Co-op>/svencoop/scripts/`, so installing
is a straight copy with the paths preserved.

Both the client's `/install` command and `tools/install_plugin.py` call in here,
so there is one implementation of what installing means.
