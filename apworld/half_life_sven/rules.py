"""Access rules.

Two kinds of gate exist:

* **Mission unlocks** -- entering a mission needs its unlock item, except for the
  goal mission and any mission paired with it, which open once
  `missions_required` other missions are done.
* **Weapon gates** -- expressed as "any one of this group of weapons". They are
  attached either to a mission entrance (everything in the mission inherits it)
  or to an individual location, which is how a check that sits past the point
  where a weapon becomes necessary carries that requirement.

The groups themselves live in `tools/campaign_layout.py` and are baked into
`data/index.json`; this module only turns them into callables.
