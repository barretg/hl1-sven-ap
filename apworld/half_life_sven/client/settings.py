"""Where the client remembers the Sven Co-op install path.

The real home is Archipelago's `host.yaml`, under this world's own section, so
the path sits with every other per-game setting and can be edited by hand:

    half_life_sven_settings:
      game_folder: F:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Sven Co-op

A small JSON file is kept as a fallback for when the settings machinery is not
available (running the client outside Archipelago, or a build where the API has
moved). Earlier versions stored the path only in that file, so it is still read
and is migrated into `host.yaml` on the next save.

Every failure path is reported to the caller rather than swallowed: a save that
quietly does nothing means being asked for the install path on every launch.
