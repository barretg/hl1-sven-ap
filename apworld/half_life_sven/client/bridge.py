"""The file bridge, with no Archipelago dependency.

Keeping this importable on its own is what lets `tests/test_bridge.py` exercise
the whole protocol with no game and no server running.

Directions:
    ap_out.txt  game -> here, append-only. We keep a byte cursor so a restart
                does not replay the log and a partially written final line is
                left for the next poll.
    ap_in.txt   here -> game, a full snapshot rewritten on every change. One-shot
                deliveries ride along as `event=` lines until the game ACKs them.
