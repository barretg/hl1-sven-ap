"""Archipelago world for the single-player campaigns shipped in Sven Co-op.

The Sven Co-op campaign portal (`-sp_campaign_portal`) is the hub, and it fronts
four campaigns: Half-Life, Opposing Force, Blue Shift and They Hunger. A YAML
toggle decides which of them a seed contains.

Within each, a mission is locked until its unlock item arrives and weapons must
be received before they can be picked up. Every enabled campaign hands you one of
its missions at the start, and every enabled campaign's finale is a goal: the
seed is won when all of them are done.
