"""Universal Tracker support.

UT re-runs this world's generation locally to work out what is in logic. Two of
our decisions are rolled rather than derived: which mission each campaign opens
with, and what the run starts holding: so UT is handed the real seed's answers
through `interpret_slot_data` and reads them back out of
`multiworld.re_gen_passthrough`.

The failure mode these guard against is silent: a passthrough read whose key was
never put into slot data just falls back to a fresh roll, and UT's logic view
drifts from the server's with nothing to show for it.
